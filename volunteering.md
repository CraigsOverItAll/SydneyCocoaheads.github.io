There are a whole bunch of ways you can get involved at CocoaHeads. Firstly of course come along and get to know the community :) If and when you feel you would like to get involved and help out, here are some things we're looking for help with. We're also always open to hear other ideas.

Venue
=====

Atlassian gracefully supply us with a place to meet as well as food and drink each month. There are still some things we need to do however. Each month ahead of time we contact Atlassian, confirm the meetup date and give them a forecast of our RSVP numbers. On the night we usually need to configure the room (setting out chairs, drink tubs, ice, drinks etc.) which for 100 chairs takes a little while. Then we need to make sure things are packed down and cleaned up before the last person leaves.

Opportunity
-----------

I'd love it if somebody would be willing to own this responsibility. Every month there are always people willing to lend a hand with chairs etc. but it would be great if someone could take care of communicating with Atlassian and then making sure there are a few people coming to help with the setup. If you love lists you might even like to make a roster ;)

Video Editing
=============

Every month, Konstantin very faithfully records camera footage. Somewhat less reliably I remember to record the screen and microphone audio via Atlassian's in-house system. Then about twice a year I manage to get the time to edit and publish a video. It's going to be easy to improve on that! Again it would be great if someone could help out with this, there are a few things that could help.

Opportunity
-----------

One would be taking care of things on the night: making sure we have Atlassian's system set to record (it's a little awkward), taking care of any speakers who might need adapters etc., and then liaising with Atlassian some time later to download the video/audio of the night.

Another would be to actually put the videos together. This is basically syncing the tracks adding the leader and trailer and switching between camera and screen at appropriate points. All this is pretty easy in Final Cut Pro X. One slight pain is that the Atlassian recording system decides to stop and restart recording at somewhat random intervals so there are a few places through a night where you need to switch to camera and scratch audio. Or if you feel inclined we can improve our recording mechanism - I have an HDMI-USB recorder that works pretty well for capturing screen output or you can get speakers to do screen recording (the latter of course doesn't work for iOS and has its own quirks). And ideally we'd have a sponsor buy us our own wireless lapel mike and record directly from that etc. There doesn't seem any way to get an xlr or other output directly from the Atlassian "enterprise" av setup :)

Diversity Committee
===================

I'm leaving the best for last. I'm really excited about what we can accomplish with CocoaHeads in the future, and that's going to need all kinds of people involved. I discussed this at some length in the February meetup (if you missed that you should read up on our new [policies](/policies) where you'll find more about this).

We're putting together a small group of people to do two things. One is to help design and put together events that help promote diversity in CocoaHeads, the first being the speaker training I alluded to in February. We will have sponsorship of real dollars to help do something really great. The other is to be point-people for anyone who has a concern related to Code of Conduct, Values or Diversity.

Opportunity
-----------

I am placing constraints on who we will consider for this group.

Of course we will be looking for diversity of all kindsâ€”to use the words of our [Diversity policy](/policies/#diversity),

> In alphabetical order, some of these attributes include (but are not limited to): age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental difference, politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture. We welcome people regardless of the values of these or other attributes.

The other constraint is that we won't be considering anyone who is "CocoaHeads establishment". That might seem a bit odd, but the whole point here is to get new and fresh ideas, otherwise I'd just ask myself :)

With a few people involved this shouldn't actually be too much work. In addition, you'll have Fiona Chan, Manuel Chakravarty and myself for advice.

I am, of course, a programmer so please forgive my use of the word *constraint* ;) If you feel any kind of urge to be involved in this, or have any questions, please email me. No idea or question is silly.
