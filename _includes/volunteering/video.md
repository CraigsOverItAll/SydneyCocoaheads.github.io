Video Editing
=============

Every month, Konstantin very faithfully records camera footage. Somewhat less reliably I remember to record the screen and microphone audio via Atlassian's in-house system. Then about twice a year I manage to get the time to edit and publish a video. It's going to be easy to improve on that! Again it would be great if someone could help out with this, there are a few things that could help.

Opportunity
-----------

One would be taking care of things on the night: making sure we have Atlassian's system set to record (it's a little awkward), taking care of any speakers who might need adapters etc., and then liaising with Atlassian some time later to download the video/audio of the night.

Another would be to actually put the videos together. This is basically syncing the tracks adding the leader and trailer and switching between camera and screen at appropriate points. All this is pretty easy in Final Cut Pro X. One slight pain is that the Atlassian recording system decides to stop and restart recording at somewhat random intervals so there are a few places through a night where you need to switch to camera and scratch audio. Or if you feel inclined we can improve our recording mechanism - I have an HDMI-USB recorder that works pretty well for capturing screen output or you can get speakers to do screen recording (the latter of course doesn't work for iOS and has its own quirks). And ideally we'd have a sponsor buy us our own wireless lapel mike and record directly from that etc. There doesn't seem any way to get an xlr or other output directly from the Atlassian "enterprise" av setup :)
