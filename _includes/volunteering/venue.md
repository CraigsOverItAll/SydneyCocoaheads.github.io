Venue
=====

Atlassian gracefully supply us with a place to meet as well as food and drink each month. There are still some things we need to do however. Each month ahead of time we contact Atlassian, confirm the meetup date and give them a forecast of our RSVP numbers. On the night we usually need to configure the room (setting out chairs, drink tubs, ice, drinks etc.) which for 100 chairs takes a little while. Then we need to make sure things are packed down and cleaned up before the last person leaves.

Opportunity
-----------

I'd love it if somebody would be willing to own this responsibility. Every month there are always people willing to lend a hand with chairs etc. but it would be great if someone could take care of communicating with Atlassian and then making sure there are a few people coming to help with the setup. If you love lists you might even like to make a roster ;)
