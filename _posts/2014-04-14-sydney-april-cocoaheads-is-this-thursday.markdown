That's right, Jason is away so here is your late announcement of Sydney CocoaHeads - I can barely remember how to work Google Groups!

All good programmers are optimisers at heart, and this fortnight is the best opportunity of the year to cash in the least number of annual day leaves in exchange for the most actual holidaying! Probably partly due to that I don't have any firm talks locked in for this week.


_What's On_




Adam Iredale is going to tell us about his new library to make use of iCloud Keychain (I was going to say exploit iCloud Keychain, but despite being correct usage of the English language it might send the wrong message).




**Update: We also have Chris McChubs giving a lightning talk on "The Origins of ObjC". Chris assures me it is well researched and there will be no need for heckling :)**




I had planned to show off a cool Bluetooth thing I've been doing in my spare time, but it's not quite ready for demo-ing yet so I'll vacate my spot. I figure we can just have more social time and also some time for anyone to demo their latest apps if anyone wants to - no RSVP required, just let me know on the night.


CocoaHeads is held it Atlassian, and that means you get free beer and pizza.

**When:** Thursday April 17th, 6:30pm
**Where:** Atlassian (Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia)
**Map:** http://goo.gl/Pm0lA

_Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed thereâ€™s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St. There will be a sign saying CocoaHeads with a mobile number to call if you can't get up in the lift._
