It's soon time for CocoaHeads November, and we're back at Roamz who kindly provided us space last month also (Check out their new release on the app store!).

After last month's sombre meeting we have a few exciting things to look forward to!


# **November CocoaHeads**


**When: **Thursday November 3rd, 6:30 PM - 9:00 PM

**Where:** Roamz, 23 Foster Street, Surry Hills NSW [http://g.co/maps/6p6ds](http://g.co/maps/6p6ds)

Speaking for November is CocoaHeads regular Manuel Betancurt talking about **Physical computing and the iPhone, sensing and actuating  the world**_._ It will include demo's of a robotic kit and a _very awesome neuron measuring system_**.**

You won't want to miss it!

I'll keep my talk on the new core data threading model up my sleeve, but I suspect that Manuel's talk/demo will prompt enough Q&A to fill the night.

And, as alluded to last month:


# **December CocoaHeads is in November**

# Mike Lee, World's Toughest Programmer


CocoaHeads Sydney, with YOW! Conference and Atlassian are pleased to present Mike Lee speaking on Product Engineering. Come early for pizza and beer, meet new people, catch up with old friends.

Legendary product engineer and World's Toughest Programmer Mike Lee ([@bmf](http://twitter.com/bmf)) has worked on apps for Alaska Airlines, Delicious Monster, Tapulous, United Lemur, Apple, and Nextive, producing such hits as Delicious Library, Tap Tap Revenge, Obama '08, and Apple's Mobile Store.


## Mike Lee talks on Product Engineering


The plan for cashing in on a "million dollar idea" tends to start with step 1, an idea, and end with step 3, profit. The mysterious step 2 turns out to be the hard part, both because it is mysterious, and because it is much, much more complicated than one bullet point will allow.After having a doctor with a flashlight explain where ideas come from, we'll explore step 2. We'll start with presenter Mike Lee's $1,000 an hour idea refinement service. Then we'll lay out the steps necessary to turn a refined idea into a product...

As space is limited and we expect this to be very popular outside CocoaHeads, you need to register for your (free) ticket. Here are the details:
