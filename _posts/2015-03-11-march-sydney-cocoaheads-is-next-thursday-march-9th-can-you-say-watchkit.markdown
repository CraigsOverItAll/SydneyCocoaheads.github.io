It’s an exciting month in Apple Land and we’ve got a great lineup for our March CocoaHeads.




Phil Farrugia is going to give us a very timely talk “Insight into Watch” and Sye Boddeus has prepared a talk titled “Spirited Design” which, and I quote, “will be relevant in a couple of ways”.




And if Craig and I can find enough stickers we’ll come up with some sort of sticker quiz.




As always, CocoaHeads is held at Atlassian, which means free pizza and beer!




**When:** Thursday March 19th, 6:30pm  
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)) _Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
