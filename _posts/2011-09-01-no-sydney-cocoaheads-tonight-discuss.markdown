Sydney CocoaHeads *should* be meeting tonight, as the first Thursday  
of the month, but unfortunately events have conspired against us. I am  
in Melbourne putting the final touches to Swipe Conference, and my two  
pre-prepared backup people are out of action (Craig just generally out  
of action and Nathan is at a WebDirections event).  
  
So that leaves us (ie. you) without an organiser or a venue. Perhaps  
people want to discuss a social get together at a pub somewhere? Sorry  
for the late notice. Please discuss on the list ( [http://groups.google.com/group/cocoaheadsau](http://groups.google.com/group/cocoaheadsau) ) since no one reads the comments on this blog!  
  
In any event, there will be plenty of post-Swipe excitement for next  
month's meetup!
