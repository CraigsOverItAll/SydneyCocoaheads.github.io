Hi all,




Welcome back to everyone who isn’t still on holidays. It’s the third Thursday in January this week so that means time for Sydney CocoaHeads to kick off for 2015.




First up Sebastian is going to do a talk about applying Functional Programming Abstractions. I had a few people ask about the embedded web server in the quiz program I made for our end of year party so I thought I’d show a little code about how that works.




As always, CocoaHeads is held at Atlassian, which means free pizza and beer!




**When:** Thursday January 15th, 6:30pm  
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)) _Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
