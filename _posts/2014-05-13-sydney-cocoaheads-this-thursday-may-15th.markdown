CocoaHeads is on again this week - Thursday night, May 15th. And you thought Mark's announcement was late...

This month Mark himself will be talking about "Modelling complex asynchronous tasks with NSOperation".

CocoaHeads is held it Atlassian, and that means you get free beer and pizza (now including gluten free options!).

**When:** Thursday May 15th, 6:30pm
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA))
_Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
