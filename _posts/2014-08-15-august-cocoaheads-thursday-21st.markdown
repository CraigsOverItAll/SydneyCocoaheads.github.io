Hi all,




August CocoaHeads is next week - Thursday 21st.

As widely promoted over the past few months, we have Manuel Chakravarty presenting on Swift— Adopting functional programming. Ever the professional, Manuel has given me an abstract for his talk!

Apple’s new language Swift supports functional programming while being tightly integrated with Objective-C and Cocoa. This has sent the developer community on an adventure to explore how ideas from functional programming might help writing great apps for iOS and OS X. In this talk, I will concentrate on two of these ideas: types and immutable data structures. How do they benefit development, and how do they affect code architecture?

Matt Tonkin will do a short talk on using CloudKit.







And finally, Everyone’s favourite heckler Craig Stanford will be handing out some stickers in exchange for correct quiz question answers.







As always, CocoaHeads is held at Atlassian, which means free pizza and beer!




**When:** Thursday August 21st, 6:30pm **Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)) _Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
