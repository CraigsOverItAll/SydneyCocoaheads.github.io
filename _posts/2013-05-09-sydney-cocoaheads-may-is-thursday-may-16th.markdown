This month we have two great talks - I have to say the first is great because they're our sponsor, and the second is me!




**Bamboo Kung Fu**




James Dumay from Atlassian will be giving a talk on doing Continuous Integration for iOS and Mac projects with Bamboo. Anyone who has ever struggled getting CI running smoothly with Xcode will be early for the best seats I'm sure!




**Will it ever stop? Yo, KVO - turn off the lights, and I'll glow**




And as promised I'll be giving a talk titled on the improved KVO implementation that I've written.




Otherwise, same details as last month:




**When: **Thursday May 16th, 6:30pm




**Where:** Atlassian




[Level 6, 341 George St](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)  
[Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)




It's the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there's a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St.




See you there!
