We're on again for April, the first Thursday of the month as always :) That's next week, April 5th.




And this month we're returning to our regular venue at Roamz,Â 23 Foster Street, Surry Hills NSW [http://g.co/maps/6p6ds](http://g.co/maps/6p6ds) at 6:30pm.




Following the same format as last month, we'll have one speaker and I'd love to have some people show off their latest work and talk about something interesting involved, or solicit feedback, or both - like Matt's talk last month about his cycling app or Tom's talk about his lighting controller app. You can either let me know in advance that you'd like to do that or take your chance on the night.




I am very excited about our main talk - CocoaHeads Sydney sometime regular **Nathan de Vries** (@atnan) will be giving his last (for now) talk before heading off to Cupertino to join the mothership. He's given me a hint about his topic and it will be pretty cool. If you missed him last year at Swipe don't miss this opportunity to hear him talk for free!




Speaking of conferences, we have a great sponsor this month in the **[One More Thing conference](http://onemorething.com.au/)** in Melbourne late May. Anthony will be giving away a **free ticket** worth $249! We'll come up with some way to randomly choose a winner possibly involving twitter on the night.




See you all there.
