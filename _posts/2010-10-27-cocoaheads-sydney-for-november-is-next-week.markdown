Thursday, November 4, 2010 18:30 at Agency Rainford - 2-12 Foveaux St, Surry Hills, Sydney

First Thursday of the month == CocoaHeads+NSCoder Sydney (combination of CocoaHeads and hack night so bring your laptop!).

This month we will be hearing from Alan Rogers of Blind Mice Studios and Upsies fame. Alan will be talking about creating custom UI elements.

I'm also putting out the call again for some lightning talks - 5 minutes or less and they can be on any topic you want, hopefully at least *vaguely* related to computer programming! Email me if you're interested [mark@pumptheory.com](mailto:mark@pumptheory.com)

As always with NSCoder there will be plenty of time to yak and hack away and share knowledgeâ€”so bring your laptop, code and questions.

We are meeting at Agency Rainford again, the same as last month. There's good seats and cheap overflow seats, so don't be late ;)

In respect to our generous hosts, please register your attendance intentions on the CocoaHeads Sydney EventBrite event: [http://CocoaHeadsSydney.eventbrite.com](http://CocoaHeadsSydney.eventbrite.com)

No need to bother printing the pdf ticket you will receive via email. Sorry to change again from the wiki, but everyone complained that the wiki didn't work in mobile Safari!

The door should be open, come up to level 2 and hunt around until you find Agency Rainford (If I remember we'll put up some signs). If the door is locked or you get lost call Nathan on 0438 284 245 or me on 0438 700 647.
