Sorry to shout, but it's always tricky to remember the first Thursday of the month can sneak up on you when it's the actual first of the month.




Look out, I'm going to shout again:




TEMPORARY VENUE CHANGE




Due to an event at Roamz this week, we needed a temporary venue for this month. NineMSN have kindly agreed to host us again, as they did last year so many of you will remember where that is, in the building above Australia Square. 264-278 George St, Sydney.




Thursday, March 1, 2012 18:30 at NineMSN, level 7, 264-278 George St, Sydney, Manhattan room

This month we have Cameron Barrie, who has whipped up an awesome talk:




**Chuck Testa's guide to skinning your apps**




Cam will be talking about how to approach all your custom-ui skinning requirements - both skumorphic and non-skumorphic. As well as some practical examples he will be talking about his approach to working out an approach. So I guess it's a meta-meta talk!




We don't have a second speaker this month, partly to make sure Cam has enough time, and also to give us time for people to talk about their apps etc. and general chin-wagging.




This month's beer sponsor is Recruiting firm The Ruby Group ([http://therubygroup.com.au](http://therubygroup.com.au/)) who have a genuinely interesting opportunity we'll mention on the night.




See you all there.
