September CocoaHeads is on this week -  Thursday, September 19th.

This month, **Jonas Budelmann** will be delivering his talk **Lost in Translation - Programmatic View Layout**, which is an exploration of some of more 'traditional' code based view layout techniques, why/when to use AutoLayout, and why to use Masonry over vanilla AutoLayout.

Alongside that, **Cameron Barrie** will be give us his long awaited talk - **Stop killing Unicorns with your AppDelegate madness**.

And... Mark is back! So don't forget to give him a tickle.

You'll find us at Atlassian, which means beer & pizza.

See you then!

**When:** Thursday September 19th, 6:30pm
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA))
_Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
