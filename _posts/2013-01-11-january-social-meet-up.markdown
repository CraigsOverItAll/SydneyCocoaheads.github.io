After some discussion on the tweets it's been decided we'll have a social meet up next Thursday Jan 17th at the James Squire Brew House (now called the King Street Brewhouse I think...), Darling Harbour. Not intentionally, that works out to be the third Thursday of the month which our monthly meetings might move to, venue pending.







Anyway see you all there!







Update: here's the venue's (surprisingly slow) website:Â [http://www.kingstbrewhouse.com.au/](http://www.kingstbrewhouse.com.au/)
