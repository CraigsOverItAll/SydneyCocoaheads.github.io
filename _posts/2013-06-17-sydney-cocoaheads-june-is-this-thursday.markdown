Hi all,




We're on again this Thursday with a talk and some time for hacking and WW banter, in the comfort of the Atlassian rec room - ask Craig to show you the cool demo he's hacked together with UISomethingOrOther (and even found a bug alread :)




Same deets as last month:




**When: **Thursday June 20th, 6:30pm




**Where:** Atlassian




[Level 6, 341 George St](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)  
[Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)




It's the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there's a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St.




See you there!
