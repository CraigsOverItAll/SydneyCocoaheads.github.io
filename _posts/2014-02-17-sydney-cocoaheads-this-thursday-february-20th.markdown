CocoaHeads is on again this week - Thursday night, February 20th.

This week we've got Scott Brewer joining us to speak about Enso Locate - a bluetooth LE powered indoor positioning toolkit. Additionally, Lawrence Lomax will be giving his insights into Remote Service Clients - done the easy way!

Make sure you make it along as this will be Lawrence's last Sydney CocoaHeads before he flees our shores ... help us send him off with a bang.

CocoaHeads is held it Atlassian, and that means free pizza and beers.

**When:** Thursday February 20th, 6:30pm
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA))
_Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
