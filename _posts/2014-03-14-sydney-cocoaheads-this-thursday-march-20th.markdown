CocoaHeads is on again next week - Thursday night, March 20th.

This month James Dumay will be speaking on "building modular applications with bundles".

This month we'll be meeting in the lunch room (still on level 6 - the same room as the Christmas trivia night).

CocoaHeads is held it Atlassian, and that means you get free beer and pizza.

**When:** Thursday March 20th, 6:30pm
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA))
_Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
