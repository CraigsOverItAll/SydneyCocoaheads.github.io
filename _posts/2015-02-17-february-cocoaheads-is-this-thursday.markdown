Snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, we have a great line up for Februrary CocoaHeads this thursday.




_Craig Stanford_ ([@thepaddedcell](https://twitter.com/thepaddedcell)) is going to give a UI talk titled “Affine Transformers: more than meets the i!"




And we have a special guest all the way from sunny Melbourne, _Mike Koukoullis_ ([@kouky](https://twitter.com/kouky)) talking on Adaptive Layouts.




Finally I have some nice laptop stickers so I’m going to do a sticker quiz—buff up on your tech news from the month…




As always, CocoaHeads is held at Atlassian, which means free pizza and beer!




**When:** Thursday February 19th, 6:30pm  
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)) _Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
