With our illustrious Sydney leader jaunting around the globe, you suckers are left with Craig hosting this month!

We have another great lineup with Craig Edwards from _[REDACTED]*_ giving a talk entitled “**_Pipe Dreams - Getting your build & deployment pipeline sorted_**”. That’ll be followed by two lightning talks, one by Chris Hulbert entitled **“Hide yo keys, hide yo bytes”** & one by Gordon Childs entitled **“Dollar Dollar Links Yo!”****.

If everyone is still enjoying them, I’ll also do another short quiz with some awesome stickers on offer. I’m open to suggestions on themes too, just shoot me an email or tweet at me.

As always, CocoaHeads is held at Atlassian, which means free pizza and beer!
**When:** Thursday October 16th, 6:30pm
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA))
_Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._

* Ask Craig on the night why it’s [REDACTED]
** Names of talks may not actually be real. I might have just invented them on the spot.
