I'm enjoying the cold rainy weather down here in Melbourne for the Apple University Consortium /dev/world conference so I can't wait to be back in cold rainy Sydney for CocoaHeads on Thursday!




  
Exciting news for this month is a new venue — we're back in Surry Hill thanks to the Roamz guys!




  
The usual date and time, October 6th (first Thursday of the month), 6:30 pm.  
The new address is 23 Foster Street, Surry Hills NSW 2010.

I'm might roll out my /dev/world talk — it's more core data, specifically the new stuff in Lion and iOS neutrino (abstract at [http://auc.edu.au/DevWorld+Sessions+2011](http://g.co/maps/6p6ds)).




  
I have a few feelers out for another talk, but I think they are going to be away. If you have something you'd love to talk about let me know, or we can finish up with a hack night.




  
Come and let's welcome the Roamz guys into the Apple fold. See you all there!
