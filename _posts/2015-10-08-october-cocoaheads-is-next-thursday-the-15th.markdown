**_Migrating a development team to VIPER_** with Jean-Étienne




 




Jean-Étienne will be performing a reprise of his YOW! Connected talk about migrating a development team to the VIPER architecture. Come along and learn how not to make the same mistakes :) If you’ve never heard of VIPER, there’s a good primer on objc.io: [Architecting iOS Apps with VIPER](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/)




 




**_Lightning Talks/Demos  
_**[new] we have a demo from Alexander of his SpriteKit game for tvOS




 




We’re at our usual digs thank’s to Atlassian again this month. For the first time in a few months I will actually be there—hooray!




**When:** Thursday October 15th, 6:30pm  
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)) _Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
