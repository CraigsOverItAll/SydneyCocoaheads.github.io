CocoaHeads May is this Thursday (always tricky to remember when it's so early in the month).

Back at our regular venue at Roamz, 23 Foster Street, Surry Hills NSW [http://g.co/maps/6p6ds](http://g.co/maps/6p6ds) at 6:30pm.

In case you haven't taken the hint already, you should checkout the Roamz app - [http://itunes.com/Roamz/Roamz](http://itunes.com/Roamz/Roamz) :)

This month/week we have Chris Hulbert who is going to do a combo app demo/mini talk on Cryptography, Dropbox Sync and Marketing/Sales – which sounds pretty interesting and not really all that mini!

We'll kick off with Chris Hulbert's talk, then head into a hack night where we can share ideas, ask questions, or just hack away. Hack night's don't run on beer alone, so this month's sponsor LookAhead Recruiting (many of you will know Steve Gilles) will be providing Pizza! Get there on time to make sure we count you for the order.
