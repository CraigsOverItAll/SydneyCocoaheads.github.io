Happy new year! January CocoaHeads is this week - Thursday night, January 16th.

To kick us directly into the unsuspecting face of 2014 we'll be hearing from David Reidy who will speaking on "cross platform development - the obsessive way". Not only that, but we've also got Sebastian Grail giving us a demo of "Shape Lab" - an app for primary school geometry that’s all about creating and manipulating shapes.

CocoaHeads is held it Atlassian, and that means free pizza and beers. See you there!

**When:** Thursday January 16th, 6:30pm  
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA))  
_Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
