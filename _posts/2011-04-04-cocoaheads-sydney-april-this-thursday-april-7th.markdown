Thursday, April 7, 2011 18:30 at KeyOptions office is 202 at 250 Pitt St in the city




CocoaHeads Sydney 2011 March is Thursday the 3rd. Comes quickly after short February!




We will be meeting again at the same KeyOptions office as last month - 202 at 250 Pitt St in the city. The door to the lift well is locked at that time of night, so people will need to call up for access. Call 9269 9125 or 0438 700 647and someone will come down to let you in.

Beer sponsor is currently open for this month—join NineMSN, KeyOptions, Pumptheory, Cameron Barrie and Nathan de Vries in supporting this worthy cause!




David Reidy will be giving his much anticipated talk on Automated UI Testing with Instruments.




There is another possible talk that I am in the process of confirming—stay tuned.




If we're lucky, the Wizard of id may be persuaded to give us a demo of his awesome script automating adding UUIDs to your AdHoc certificates.




Tom from BareFeetWare is taking a break this month, but resume his twelve part series on UITableView and Cell implementations next month :)




See you all there!




Mark.
