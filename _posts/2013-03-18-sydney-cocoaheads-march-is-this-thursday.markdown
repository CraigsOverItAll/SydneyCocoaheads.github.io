Sorry for the late reminder, but you all have recurring calendar appointments right?!




I had been mulling over how to best handle our clash with YOW! and a late speaker postponement has resulted in the following compromise. We'll just have the one talk (by me!) this month, and so we'll kick off with an extended pizza/drinks/social time followed by my talk a bit later so people can head straight over from YOW! (which finishes quite early usually) if they want.




I've prepared a talk on CocoaPods which is something I've become very fond of lately and I know is a bit of a hot topic. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, check out [http://cocoapods.org](http://cocoapods.org).




If you have no idea what YOW! is, you might want to check it out: [http://www.yowconference.com.au/general/yownights.html](http://www.yowconference.com.au/general/yownights.html)




Otherwise, same details as last month:




**When: **Thursday March 21st, 6:30pm




**Where:** Atlassian




[Level 6, 341 George St](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)  
[Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)




It's the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there's a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St.




See you there!
