Well last week was fantastic at WWDC. I'm looking forward to all the exciting apps and talks that will come out of the new APIs (with due respect to the NDA of course :)




In unrelated news, I am making a belated attempt to get up to date with slide decks on this blog. The first of Tom's epic series of talks is available in the github account:
