CocoaHeads is held it Atlassian - which means free pizza and beers. See you there!

**When:** Thursday December 19th, 6:30pm

**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA))
_Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
