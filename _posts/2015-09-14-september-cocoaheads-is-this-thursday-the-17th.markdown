Those of you, like me, who were sad to miss Sebastian’s talk last month will be pleased to hear that he couldn’t present it last month (not that we’re in any way happy that you were sick Sebastian ;) and will instead be talking this week.

**_React Native_** with Rob




We’re back at our usual digs thank’s to Atlassian again this month. Unfortunately I will be missing out again, being down in Melbourne for YOW! Connected so I will be leaving you in the (hopefully) capable hands of Matt Tonkin to MC and as ever Atlassian’s best employee Nick to make sure everyone has beer and pizza. 👍Nick :)




**When:** Thursday September 17th, 6:30pm  
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)) _Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
