This time we're **really** back in business!




And it's Core Data month, with Craig Stanford doing a talk on MagicalRecord (taking the pain out of Core Data) and Alan Rogers doing a short talk on how he takes the pain out of multi-threaded Core Data.




It's also giveaway month!




Firstly we have 5 (count them, five!) tickets to giveaway for Mobile YOW! Night Sydney, August 24. YOW! Mobile night is a once a year event - last year our own Nathan de Vries spoke, this year yours truly is speaking! Those who miss out, the Mobile YOW! night is only $10. [http://yownightsydmobile.eventbrite.com/ ](http://yownightsydmobile.eventbrite.com/)(YOW! Conference is a developer conference you should check out - it's in December and despite all the Microsoft people in attendance it promises to be awesome with speakers like Simon Peyton Jones, Chad Fowler and Mary Poppendieck. [http://www.yowconference.com.au/ ](http://www.yowconference.com.au/))




You might also be interested to know that there will be 1 (count them, one!) Swipe Conference ticket being given away, and details will _only_ be available at the YOW! Mobile night.




But wait, there's more! While talking about Magical Record, by Saul from Magical Panda, Craig will have Magical Panda pins and stickers to give away.




And finally, I will give a an excellent vinyl Pumptheory.com sticker to the first 5 people to correctly tweet to me ([@markaufflick](http://twitter.com/markaufflick)) how many exclamation marks there are in this message, with a link to [http://sydneycocoaheads.com](http://sydneycocoaheads.com) in the tweet!




Craig Stanford will again be hosting us all at NineMSN. NineMSN is the building above Australia Square. 264-278 George St, Sydney.




Thursday, August 4, 2011 18:30 at NineMSN, level 7, 264-278 George St, Sydney, Manhattan room

We are meeting on Level 7 in the Manhattan room. Level 7 is public access and the room is directly in front of the lifts. The lifts do lock down level 7 at some point though, so if the lift won't take you to level 7 give Craig a buzz on (0431 019 676), or me on 0438 700 647




Mark.
