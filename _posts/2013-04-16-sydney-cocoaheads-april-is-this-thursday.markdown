Hi all,




We're on again this Thursday with two great talks.




CocoaHeads regular Doron Katz is doing a talk on some cloud service options for your app (*cough* not iCloud) for data, purchases and push notifications.




CocoaHeads new injection Lawrence Lomax not only has the third best name after Max Power and Scott Speed, he's going to give us all a lesson titled "Super! Awesome! Functional! Reactive! with ReactiveCocoa". Apparently it's something to do with cats.




Same deets as last month:




**When: **Thursday April 18th, 6:30pm




**Where:** Atlassian




[Level 6, 341 George St](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)  
[Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)




It's the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there's a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St.




See you there!
