Hi all,




As always (or nearly always), Sydney CocoaHeads is the third Thursday of the month which is July 18, next Thursday, and as has become a bit of a trend lately I will be overseas, on a somewhat unplanned trip sampling the delightful beer and chocolate combination of Belgium.




Your friend and mine Barefeet Tom from BarefeetWare who will ironically probably not be barefoot has "volunteered" to be the MC for the night.




Tom Jowett will be giving a talk on using CoreData with UIManagedDocument (hopefully avoiding a punch up with the MC).




The second speaker slot is still free - let me or Tom know if you would like to speak or if you want to do a quick app demo etc.




Same deets as last month:




**When: **Thursday July 18th, 6:30pm




**Where:** Atlassian




[Level 6, 341 George St](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)  
[Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)




It's the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there's a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St.




Don't have too much fun without me!




Mark.
