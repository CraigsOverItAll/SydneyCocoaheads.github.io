Hi all,

To streamline our communications a little, from now on meetup notifications will only be posted to our Meetup.com group and to the mailing list. This blog will be for other kinds of posts, like videos or slides etc, and the cocoaheads.org page will be updated simply to point to this page and meetup.com.

On this web page, the embedded meetup widget up the top will be kept up to date, but if you're using this blog RSS feed to stay up to date you'll want to look at the rss & ical feeds on meetup.com.

* Page with RSS/Atom/iCal feeds down the bottom is [here](http://www.meetup.com/sydneycocoaheads/events/)
