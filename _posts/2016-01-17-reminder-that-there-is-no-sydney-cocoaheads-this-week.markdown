Hi all,




Just a quick message for any who missed the announcements I made at the past two meetups, or after Christmas and New Years have forgotten, we are taking January off, and so the first Sydney CocoaHeads of 2016 will be February 18th.




I hope everyone enjoys the break and see you all next month ready for a big new year of Cocoa!




Cheers,




Mark.
