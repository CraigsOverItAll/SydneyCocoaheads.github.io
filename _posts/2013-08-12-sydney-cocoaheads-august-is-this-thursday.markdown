CocoaHeads is upon us again, this Thursday!

Mark will be away again this Thursday, so Craig Stanford will be our illustrious MC.

On top of the MC gig, Craig will be giving quite the _dynamic_ talk on a new thing from a new version of iOS. And Cameron Barrie will be preaching on the UIViewController obesity epidemic.

As usual, we're holding it at Atlassian. There will be Beer & Pizza.

**When:** Thursday August 15th, 6:30pm

**Where:** Atlassian
[Level 6, 341 George St

It’s the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St.
