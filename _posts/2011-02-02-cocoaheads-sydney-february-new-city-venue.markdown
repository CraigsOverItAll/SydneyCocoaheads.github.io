As per the discussion on the mailing list, CocoaHeads Sydney is ready to kick off for another exciting year!




As many of you may know, the kind hosts for much of last year, the awesome guys behind Agency Rainford, have moved onto bigger and better things and CocoaHeads has a new venue.




KeyOptions have kindly offered their offices as our new venue, where we will be meeting tomorrow. The next (indeterminate) few months will also be at KeyOptions but possibly in their yet-to-be-opened new offices.




The KeyOptions office is 202 at 250 Pitt St in the city. The door to the lift well is locked at that time of night, so people will need to call up for access. Call 9269 9125 and someone will come down to let you in.

Glen Trudgett is going to be leading a Quiz/Trivia time on Cocoa fundamentals which should spark some heated debate :)




I think Tom is going to talk about sqlite - unless I have my months mixed up! If not then I have some pretty funky code to estimate folder size that shows some interesting C techniques that might be new to some of you.




As you can tell, I'm a little disorganised this month so no signup page - I'll just assume less than 200 people will turn up. See you all there!




Mark.
