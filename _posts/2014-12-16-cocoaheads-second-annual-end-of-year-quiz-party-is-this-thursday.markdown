December CocoaHeads is this week! Thursday night, December 18th.




This month, being so close to Christmas, things a little different. We won't have any speakers per se... instead come prepared for pool, and trivia action. With special Swift prizes for the Swift lightning round!




CocoaHeads is held it Atlassian - which means free pizza and beers. See you there!




**When:** Thursday December 18th, 6:30pm **Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)) _Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
