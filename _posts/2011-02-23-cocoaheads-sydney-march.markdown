CocoaHeads Sydney 2011 March is Thursday the 3rd, 6:30 pm. Comes quickly after short February!




We will be meeting again at the same KeyOptions office as last month - 202 at 250 Pitt St in the city. The door tothe lift well is locked at that time of night, so people will need to call up for access. Call 9269 9125 or 0438 700 647and someone will come down to let you in.

NineMSN is supplying the beer this month - thanks to KeyOptions and Cameron Barrie for supplying last month's stash.




Tom from BareFeetWare will give a second talk in his series. Last month he laid the basics on how to build a table view driven app and cross reference the Cocoa documentation for customisation. This month he will cover customising table views with different styles, backgrounds, adding your own subviews and buttons, mimicking multiple columns and horizontal scrolling and using shading to give a 3D look.




Alan Rogers will give a lightning talk about writing Oscar Award winning software (and avoiding the obstacle course at the awards night)!




If anyone else would like to give a lightning/short talk please let me know.




See you all there!




Mark.
