Hi all,




With all the iPhone & Beta madness these days, CocoaHeads has snuck up on us - it’s THIS Thursday September 17th.




We have a few different things lined up for this month, with (accidentally) a bit of a theme of application architecture.




Our main talk for the month is by Sye Boddeus:





<blockquote>

> 
> **Architecting Complex Apps, A Personal Story**
> 
> 

> 
> _Large applications require a special focus on architecture in order to keep them maintainable, to keep information flow controlled, to keep them testable and to keep project developers sane. By going over a recent project I worked on I will illustrate by example how through understanding design patterns and different application architectures I was able to achieve these goals (mostly)._

The followup act will be by me (Mark Aufflick) – a few people have asked me to give a short (hopefully!) version of my talk from last week’s YOW! Connected conference which I readily agreed to, mostly because I like how the slides came out :)





<blockquote>

> 
> **Bluetooth LE API Design + Code Generation for iOS apps and hardware**
> 
> 

> 
> _A brief and whirlwind tour of the problem space of designing and implementing BLE communications between mobile apps and custom developed hardware/firmware where all your targets are moving! We will cover formally documenting the specification, why code-generation is good for you, and api and transport governance._
> 
> 
</blockquote>




And again like last month, Craig will have a quick quiz to give out some tasty (not literally) laptop stickers. Should be a fun night!




As always, CocoaHeads is held at Atlassian, which means free pizza and beer!




**When:** Thursday September 18th, 6:30pm
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA)) _Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
