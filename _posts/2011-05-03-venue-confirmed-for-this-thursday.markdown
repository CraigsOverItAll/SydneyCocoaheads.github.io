Ok, the venue is now confirmed. We are meeting at the offices of NineMSN. NineMSN is the building above Australia Square (which is ironic, since the building is round). 264-278 George St, Sydney.

We are meeting on Level 7 in the Manhattan room. Level 7 is public access and the room is directly in front of the lifts. The lifts do lock down level 7 at some point though, so if the lift won't take you to level 6 give me a buzz on 0438 700 647.







CORRECTION: A previous version of this post said level 6, but level 7 is the correct floor for the Manhattan room.
