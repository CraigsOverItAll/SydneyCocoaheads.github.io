CocoaHeads is on this week, with post-WWDC filled goodness!

This month we've got an action packed line up – Adam Iredale will be giving us the run down with What's New in Xcode 6, and Gordon Childs & Chris Hulbert will be bringing us their talk "Think Different" - being open minded enough to slay the sacred cows.

CocoaHeads is held at Atlassian, which means free pizza and beer.

**When:** Thursday June 19th, 6:30pm
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA))
_Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
