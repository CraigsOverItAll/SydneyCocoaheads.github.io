I’m re-posting older talks that I have as blog posts so I can replace the old and rarely-updated “Talks” page with a category.

This talk is from the very first Sydney CocoaHeads presentation meeting (there were two prior social meetings) very kindly given by André Pang literally the night before he flew out to San Francisco to join Pixar—thanks André!

Based on his earlier Mac OSX Linguistics talk, the talk covered interesting parts of the Objective-C programming language (from a programming language point of view). Topics include the underlying implementation of the object model and message-sending and higher-order messaging shenanigans.

Slides are available at [http://algorithm.com.au/talks](http://algorithm.com.au/talks).
