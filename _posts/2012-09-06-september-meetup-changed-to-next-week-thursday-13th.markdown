Hi All 


ATTN: Due to some conference (I think it's called Wipes or something) held on Thursday 6th, Sydney Cocoaheads is postponed 1 week until the 13th of September.









As usual, the venue is the Roamz office, 23 Foster Street, Surry Hills NSW [http://g.co/maps/6p6ds](http://g.co/maps/6p6ds) at 6:30pm.









Also, our usual Master of Ceremonies is out of the country so I'll be running the show & I'm looking for speakers. I don't mind if you want to speak for 30 minutes on a topic, 5 minutes about your latest app or you're stuck on a problem and want some help.







Also if there's a topic you'd like to hear about then speak up & we'll see if we can find someone.







Alternatively, we can just make it a Hack night & sit around coding, asking others for help as needed etc. What does everyone think?







Cheers,







Craig
