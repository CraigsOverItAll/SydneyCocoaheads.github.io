We had another great Sydney CocoaHeads meetup for September 2010. That's two months in a row with nearly 20 people!

Thanks again to everyone who came and especially to Cam and Nathan who gave presentations. Nathan's presentation on the Objective-C runtime and its api is listed on the [talks page](/talks/) with his slides, Cam's slides are on the way.

Here are some photos from the night:

This meetup wouldn't have been possible without our sponsors for this month:



	
  * Beer, venue and Pizza by [Snepo Research](http://www.snepo.com/) â€” if you want an interactive touch screen kiosk and software they're your people. Thanks to Cameron Barrie for graciously hosting us again.

	
  * General organisation by me, [Mark Aufflick](http://mark.aufflick.com/), who apparently doesn't send out announcement emails often enough.
