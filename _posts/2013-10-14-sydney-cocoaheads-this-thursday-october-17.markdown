September CocoaHeads is on this week -  Thursday, October 17th.

This month we're got Lawrence Lomax speaking about "Unit Testing - The Talk with 4 Titles".

We've also had a few folks express interest in showing their apps. If this is you, let me know (jason AT lynch.org.au).

CocoaHeads is held it Atlassian - and that means free pizza and beer!

See you on Thursday.

**When:** Thursday October 17th, 6:30pm
**Where:** Atlassian ([Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney, NSW, 2000, Australia](http://goo.gl/Pm0lA))
_Look for the Westpac building opposite Martin Place (next to the old Virgin Megastore) and since the bank will be closed there’s a side entrance to access the lifts on Wynyard St._
