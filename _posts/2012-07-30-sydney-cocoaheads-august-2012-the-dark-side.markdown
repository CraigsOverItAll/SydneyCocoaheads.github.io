CocoaHeads is this coming Thursday, August 2nd! These early in the month ones really sneak up on you, don't they?




As usual, the venue is the Roamz office, 23 Foster Street, Surry Hills NSW [http://g.co/maps/6p6ds](http://g.co/maps/6p6ds) at 6:30pm.




Up first this month, Nick Pellow ([@niick](http://twitter.com/niick)) will be doing the flipside of my Xcode talk last month by telling us about the apostasy of AppCode. He also has a new App in the store that he might demo for us!




Then our venerable leader, Mark Aufflick ([@markaufflick](http://twitter.com/markaufflick)), will give a quick talk on using AQXMLParser to parse XML on iOS and OSX efficiently and easily.

Beer and Pizza will be sponsored by the ever charming Steve Gilles from Lookahead ([http://www.lookahead.com.au](http://www.lookahead.com.au)), so don't go getting blind drunk before you turn up - Steve has that covered!




See you all there :)
