This month we have 2 changes from our regularly scheduled program, so I’m contacting everyone quite early.
Firstly, our illustrious organiser Mark Aufflick is out of the country, so you’re stuck with me (Craig aka @thepaddedcell) instead. #dealwithit

Secondly, and more importantly, we have a change of venue. **This month’s CocoaHeads will be held at the offices of TabCorp.**

The address is **_Level 31, 680 George Street, Sydney._** It’s the Ernst & Young building of World Square ([http://is.gd/DmsxES](http://is.gd/DmsxES)).

We will be meeting as usual on the third Thursday, which for _**August is Thursday 20th**_, starting at 6:30pm (sorry for forgetting this vital detail first time!)

Our speakers this month are:

**Sebastian Grail** will be presenting _"Introduction to Functional Reactive Programming in Swift"_

**Chris Hulbert** will be presenting _“Don’t be Slack: A navigation structure for loading, login & dashboards”_

Hope to see you there!
