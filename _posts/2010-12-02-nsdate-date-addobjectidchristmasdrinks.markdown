Tonight is the last Sydney CocoaHeads for the calendar so tradition requires that we meet up for Christmas drinks and jovial banter.

As announced previously on the mailing list, we are meeting at [Agency Rainford](http://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=2-12%20Foveaux%20St,%20Surry%20Hills,%20Sydney%20(Agency%20Rainford)&sll=-33.883795,151.209319) at 6:30 as usual, and at some point (say 7 or 7:30) will move on to Tailors.

If you can't find us, check my [twitter](http://twitter.com/markaufflick) or call me on 0438 700 647.
